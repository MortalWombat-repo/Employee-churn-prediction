# Employee-churn-prediction

This is a project as a part of [Machine learning Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp)

# About the data

The dataset is from Kaggle called [Employee Turnover](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marikastewart/employee-turnover)

Quote from the description page.
> This database is from a large US company (no name given for privacy reasons). The management department is worried about the relatively high turnover. They want to find ways to 
> reduce the number of employees leaving the company and to better understand the situation, which employees are more likely to leave, and why.
> 
> The HR department has assembled data on almost 10,000 employees who left the company between 2016-2020. They used information from exit interviews, performance reviews, and
> employee records.

# Structure of the data

| **No** | **Feature**                | **Description**                                                                 |
|--------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | `department`               | the department the employee belongs to.                                        |
| 2      | `promoted`                 | 1 if the employee was promoted in the previous 24 months, 0 otherwise.         |
| 3      | `review`                   | the composite score the employee received in their last evaluation.            |
| 4      | `projects`                 | how many projects the employee is involved in.                                 |
| 5      | `salary`                   | for confidentiality reasons, salary comes in three tiers: low, medium, high.   |
| 6      | `tenure`                   | how many years the employee has been at the company.                           |
| 7      | `satisfaction`             | The customerâ€™s occupation.                                                     |
| 8      | `bonus`                    | 1 if the employee received a bonus in the previous 24 months, 0 otherwise.     |
| 9      | `avg_hrs_month`            | the average hours the employee worked in a month.                              |
| 10     | `left`                     | "yes" if the employee ended up leaving, "no" otherwise.                        |

# Description

The data was first loaded into a Jupyter notebook `1. Data preparation and data cleaning` for data processing and cleanup. The data proved to be very clean. The most importan step of this stage was turning the target variable into a binary format from a string.
Next step was running the notebook `2. EDA, feature importance analysis`. In this notebooks certain visualizations were made to get a feel for the data to be worked with as well as feature importance analysis in form of viewing the correlations of features with each other as well as seing if any particular feature stood out.
Finally a notebook `3. Model selection process` is ran to test the dummy models before they are converted to a script in form of a `train.py`.

The script `train.py` incorporates the tested model and creates a model from vectorized data using Linear Regression from `scikit-learn` which is then tested for accuracy using the AUC(area under the curve) method. The model is then pickled.

The script `predict.py` uses Flask and gunicorn to serve the model on local host network to which `predict-test.py` sends a POST request using JSON serialized data to make the prediction to determine will the employee with specified characteristics churn or not.

# Running the project

**Important!**

This project was developed on WSL(Windows subsystem for Linux)
It is recommended if on Windows to install it using a [guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/744328/how-to-install-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux-on-windows-11/) or running it on UNIX/Linux environment.

1. cd into your desired folder and download the project
```
git clone https://github.com/MortalWombat-repo/Employee-churn-prediction.git
```
2. cd into the folder
```
cd Employee-churn-prediction
```
3. build docker container
```
docker build -t notebook .
```
4. run the container with the exposed port (very important don't forget the p flag)
```
docker run -p 9696:9696 notebook
```
5. open a new terminal tab and send a post request
```
python predict-test.py
```
6. when done return to the window with the server and CTRL/Command + C to stop the server

7. exit the directory and delete the project
```
cd ..
rm -rf Employee-churn-prediction
```
